        <h2><br><strong>Personal Information</strong></h2>
        <p>Alan Turing was an English academic who specialized in computer science, mathematics and many more, he is considered one of the most influential figures on modern computer science.
          He was born on the 23rd June 1912 in Maida Vale, London, England to Julius M. Turing and Ethel S. Turing. Alan Turing
          developed the Turing machine later in his life, his work in that aspect lead to him being labelled as the fore father of artificial intelligence and theoretical computer science. it is
          a topic aspiring students who pursue a computer science degree should all be familar with. </p>
        <h2><br><strong>Professional Career</strong></h2>
        <h4><strong>Education</strong></h4>
          1931-1934:<ul><li>Majored in Mathematics at King's College, Cambridge.</li></ul>
          1935:<ul><li>Elected Fellow of King's College.</li></ul>
          1938:<ul><li>Earned a PhD at Princeton University.</li></ul>
          1939:<ul><li>Joined the Government Codes and Ciphers School.</li></ul>

        <h4><br><strong>Famous Contributions</strong></h4>
          1936:<ul><li>The concept of the Turing Machine is published by Turing.</li></ul>
          1939-1940:<ul><li>Turing creates a device for decrypting messages sent by the Germans.</li></ul>
          1940-1942:<ul><li>Turing contributes to discovering how to read the German Naval Engima System messages in 1942.</li></ul>
          1943-1945:<ul><li>Shares findings on cryptology with the USA.</li></ul>

        <h2><br><strong>Influence on Modern Technology</strong></h2>
          <p>Turing Machine: This machine waas theorized by Turing to be able to read a tape containing symbols,
            it may be able to move in a left or right manner, the symbols could also be replaced by another or completely
            erased. Turing described the ability to perform these functions would be the modern computer.<br></p>
            <ul><li>Machines that can run indefinitely.</li>
                <li>Machines that halts.</li>
                <li>Deterministic and non-deterministic Turing Machines.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
          <p>Alan Turing saved many lives when the Enigma Code was cracked in World War II, but he continued to influence how
            modern computers were evolved and improved over time after his death in June 7 1954.</p>
